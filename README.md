## Automatic generation of visually-engaging Matlab plots 

```plotlab``` is a toolbox for the automatic generation of publication quality Matlab plots. The approach followed is to define 'recipes' which override various default plotting properties of the Matlab graphics root object, so as to generate visually-engaging, publication-ready plots, with minimal code thereby avoiding the classic paradigm of repeatedly entering boiler plate code for setting various plotting options to one's liking. Further several tutorials are included that show how to set default plotting parameters for a number of plot types that result in publication quality, highly legible and visually engaging figures with a consistent appearance across computing platforms (mac and linux) and graphics formats.

## The problem addressed
The left column in the table below depicts a simple MATLAB snippet used to generate a line/marker combo plot. The right column depicts the plot generated using this code. There are two main issues with this, and, in general, with all MATLAB default plot: illegibility, due to the small font size, the small symbol size, the the line thickness, and a lack of visual appeal.

## The plotlab solution
`plotlab` contains functionality that is called before a generic matlab plotting script so as to alter the various default plotting parameters according to the user's liking. This alteration is done by calling the `plotlab.applyRecipe()` method as shown in the left column of the table below. This method sets a number of plotting parameters to values different that the factory values, so as to improve the legibility and the visual appeal of the generated plot. The user of course can override the values of these parameters in three different ways. The first way is by passing key-value pair arguments in the `applyRecipe()` method. In the table below, the user sets only the desired figure size, accepting the values of the remaining plotting parameters set by the default receipt of `plotlab`, which again was designed with the aim of improving the visual appeal of plots. The resulting plot is depicted in the right column.
